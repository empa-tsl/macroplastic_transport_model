	# only to make file with endpoints of river sections which contain a name.
	# this specific points need to be reviewed in a GIS software and manuelly selected
	# output containers are linefeatures drown in a GIS software which are next to the outflowing river. we did this only for the bigger outflowing countries. Additionally, added two outflow container after each other. the first outflow container/linefeature passes the contamination on without any interaction while the second one is a final container. inflow always flows to the same container again....
	# we marked the outflow container with the attribute outflow == 1 for rivers and the first type of outflow and outflow == 2 for the final upsumming container.
	# outflow == 3 and outflow == 4 correspond to the first and second outflow type which recieve all pollution of dead ends or small border crossing rivers
